## Deepfake Detection System with CNN and User Interface

This project aims to develop a user-friendly system for detecting deepfakes using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a graphical user interface (GUI).

### Project Objectives

* Develop a CNN model for accurate classification of real and deepfake images/videos.
* Train the model for high accuracy and generalizability to unseen deepfakes.
* Optimize the model for efficient analysis on various platforms.
* Design a user-friendly GUI for easy image/video upload, analysis initiation, and result display.

### Getting Started

This project requires Python libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV (for image processing), and Tkinter (for GUI development). 

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow
* OpenCV
* Tkinter

**Installation:**

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python tk
```

**Data Collection (Optional):**

* If you plan to train your own model from scratch, you'll need a dataset containing real and deepfake images/videos. 
* Consider publicly available datasets or creating your own with proper labeling.

**Model Training (Optional):**

1.  Refer to `src/Model.py` for the code related to training the CNN model. This script might involve:
    * Data loading and pre-processing.
    * Model definition using TensorFlow/Keras.
    * Model compilation with optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
    * Training process with epochs and validation for performance monitoring.
    * Model saving for future use.

2.  Train the model by running the script:

```bash
python src/Model.py
```

### User Interface (GUI)

1. Refer to `src/main.py` for the code related to the user interface. This script will likely include:
    * Functions for image/video upload and analysis initiation.
    * Integration of the trained model for prediction on user-provided data.
    * Logic for displaying analysis results on the GUI.

2. Run the GUI script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```
